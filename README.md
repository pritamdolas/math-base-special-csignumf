## Overview

The **Math Base Special CSignumF** library evaluates the signum function for single-precision complex floating-point numbers. This library offers a simple and efficient way to determine the sign of a complex number in JavaScript, making it a valuable tool for developers working in fields that require mathematical computations, such as engineering, physics, and data analysis.

### What is the Signum Function?

The signum function, often denoted as `sgn`, provides the sign of a number. For a real number, it is defined as:

- `sgn(x) = -1` if `x < 0`
- `sgn(x) = 0` if `x = 0`
- `sgn(x) = 1` if `x > 0`

For complex numbers, the signum function extends to account for both the real and imaginary parts.

## Features

- **Simple Interface**: Easy to integrate into your existing projects.
- **Single-Precision Support**: Specifically designed for single-precision floating-point numbers.
- **Complex Number Handling**: Properly evaluates the signum for complex numbers.

## Installation

To get started, you need to install the package. You can do this using npm:

```bash
npm install math-base-special-csignumf
```

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to use the library in your project:

```javascript
const csignumf = require('math-base-special-csignumf');

// Example usage
const complexNumber = { re: 3.0, im: 4.0 };
const signumValue = csignumf(complexNumber);
console.log(signumValue); // Output: { re: 0.6, im: 0.8 }
```
